ResidentPCBApp is a small resident Windows project that starts automatically at login and works together with a custom kernel driver (KMDF DKOM) to launch a process, display its PCB-style attributes, and hide that process from Task Manager by removing it from the kernel’s ActiveProcessLinks list; the driver loads normally after test-signing is enabled and the app is kept persistent through a scheduled task.
